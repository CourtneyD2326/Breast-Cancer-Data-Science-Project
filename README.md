# Identification and Analysis of Key Predictive Features for Breast Cancer Outcomes: A Data-Driven Approach to Personalized Patient Care

![pink-ribbon-for-breast-cancer-awareness](https://github.com/CourtneyD2326/Breast-Cancer-Data-Science-Project/assets/85933265/ede2c68c-31f9-4475-bbe6-04a15dcbd6cb)

Breast cancer remains one of the most diagnosed and fatal cancers globally, presenting a complex and multifaceted challenge for clinicians and researchers alike. The successful diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this disease necessitate a nuanced understanding of a diverse array of factors that may contribute to its onset and progression. Leveraging the comprehensive SEER dataset for breast cancer, this project seeks to elucidate the most critical features that influence a patient's outcome, specifically their status as alive or dead post-diagnosis.

The analysis will encompass both numerical attributes (including Age at diagnosis, Tumor Size, Regional Node Examined, Regional Node Positive, and Survival Months) and categorical attributes (including Race, Marital Status, T Stage, N Stage, 6th Stage, Grade, A Stage, Estrogen Status, and Progesterone Status). By identifying and quantifying the relative importance of these features, the project aims to contribute to a more targeted and personalized approach to breast cancer care.

Through robust statistical methods and machine learning techniques, the objective is to create a predictive model that not only enhances our understanding of the disease's underlying mechanisms but also facilitates more informed clinical decision-making. This analysis will provide healthcare practitioners with insights into the most influential determinants of patient outcomes, thereby enabling more effective intervention strategies, tailored treatment plans, and improved patient counseling. Ultimately, the project aspires to translate these data-driven insights into tangible benefits for patient care, contributing to the broader efforts to combat and manage breast cancer.

## EDA : Exploratory Data Analysis

### The dataset includes the following independent features:
Numerical Attribute:
 *	Age: Age of patient at diagnosis
 * Tumor Size: Size of tumour at diagnosis
 * Regional Node Examined
 * Reginol Node Positive
 * Survival Months
   
Categorical Attribute:
 * Race: Race of patient (white, other (American Indian/ AK Native, Asian/ Pacific Islander)
 * Marital Status: Married (including common law), Single (never married), other)
 * T Stage: Tumor Size (T2, T1, other)
 * N Stage: Number of lymph nodes involved (N1, N2, other)
 * 6th Stage: Overall stage of cancer (IIA, IIB, other)
 * Grade: Grade of cancer (Moderately differentiated; Grade II, Poorly differentiated; Grade III, other)
 * A Stage: Distant metastasis status (Regional, Distant)
 * Estrogen Status
 * Progesterone Status
   
Target Variable:
 * Status: Alive or Dead
